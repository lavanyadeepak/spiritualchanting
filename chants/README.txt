This folder is a placeholder which is pointed by chants.json. Actual chant hymns are available on request and not committed to the repository for the following reasons.

1) Avoid unintentional copyright infringement if any though as much research has gone in the chants used are in public domain.
2) Version Control systems are better for text files than binary files.

Please send a message through https://lavanyadeepak.github.io/ requesting any/all of the contents in chants.json
