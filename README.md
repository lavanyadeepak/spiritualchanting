# Spiritual Chanting Tool

## A lightweight (<10MB) JavaScript engine for background chanting. Chant files managed separately.

### Why No Chants Included?

Size: Chant collections (audio files) can exceed 1GBâ€”too large for GitHub.
Flexibility: Users add their own chants (local files or external URLs).
Legal Safety: Avoid distributing copyrighted/litigious content.

### How to Use
1. Set Up Chants
Step 1: Download chants (your own or request public-domain suggestions).
Step 2: Store them outside the repo (e.g., ~/my-chants/ or cloud storage).
Step 3: Edit chants.json to point to their paths:

2. Run the Engine
Open index.html in a browser (works offline with local files).

For web deployment, host audio files separately (e.g., AWS S3, Dropbox).
